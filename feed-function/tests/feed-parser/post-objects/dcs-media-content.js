  'content:encoded': ['<p>When you design software you usually have a few use cases in mind, in the case of EpsilonGit the use case I keep coming back to is a project lead who wants an overview of how his team is working and how they are using their version control software.</p>\n<p>Back in second year when I developed <a href="https://dannycomputerscientist.wordpress.com/2012/11/11/2d-graphics-coursework-a-javascript-orrery/">The JavaScript Orrery</a> my target audience was <a href="http://www.goparker.com">David Parker</a> and the only use of the software was to impress him for degree credit.</p>\n<p>A short while later I made a few small adaptations to package the orrery as a Windows Store (now called Universal Windows) Application. I thought a few people might enjoy watching the planets go around the screen, but didn&#8217;t really expect too many people to download it. To be completely honest, I mainly packaged it as an app to get points for the <a href="https://dannycomputerscientist.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/microsoft-app-builder-rewards/">App Builder Rewards competition</a>.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t touched the orrery, packaged as Solar System Simulation on Windows, for years. However, I wrote a little while back about someone who used it to teach <a href="https://dannycomputerscientist.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/a-heartwarming-review/">their daughter about space</a>, an unexpected use but a nice one.</p>\n<p>Today I got an email from a student in Brazil who wondered if the software had a function to see planet locations at specific dates, as he liked the simple 2D graphics and wanted to use them to make a tattoo of the layout of the solar system on his birthday. Strange, but cool.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the Solar System Simulation (which is a gratuitous name &#8212; its in no way even close to a &#8216;simulation&#8217;) doesn&#8217;t support this function &#8212; but its a cool idea, and one I wouldn&#8217;t have thought of.</p>\n<p>It might be fun to add it in one day, and see how popular some of the ideas I have would be compared to those that a user has had and wanted to be implemented enough to go to the effort to email me about it. I <em>suspect</em> the user submitted ideas might be more popular, because no one knows how well a customer users your product as well as a customer. But I might be wrong, it could be an interesting bit of research.</p>\n<p>So, expect the unexpected uses of your software and services &#8212; both in positive ways, such as odd-but-exciting use cases, and negative, such as malformed input &#8212; but also be excited by the prospect.</p>\n<p>Danny</p>\n<p>P.S <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/store/Apps/Solar-System-Simulation/9WZDNCRDPBJH">&#8216;Solar System Simulation&#8217; is still available</a> and works on Windows 8, 8.1 and 10.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/dannycomputerscientist.wordpress.com/3580/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/dannycomputerscientist.wordpress.com/3580/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=dannycomputerscientist.wordpress.com&#038;blog=27683847&#038;post=3580&#038;subd=dannycomputerscientist&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />'],
