&lt;p&gt;Many students spend the few days (weeks) after finishing university drinking heavily and enjoying themselves. I
however had my eye on an epic bike ride for a few months and used the downtime as the perfect opportunity to cycle from Hull to Leicester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Edge Of Humberside" src="/images/edge-of-humberside.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole trip covered 110 miles of Humberside, Lincolnshire and Leicestershire. Passing over the Humber bridge, through Lincoln and through many many villages on the way.
It was quite a nice day, conditions were good and my spirits were high throughout. The day started at 6am and I arrived as planned in time for a friends birthday meal out - perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Harby Hill" src="/images/harby-hill.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, a great day out cycling and much better than stumbling home at 4am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time since I last posted, a lot has happened but I've largely been touring The North™ on my bike. As usual there has been plenty of
development action, however I'll leave that for future posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Old Trafford" src="/images/oldtrafford.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been to plenty of football matches, at the KC here in Hull, Old Trafford and of course the King Power Stadium back in Leicester.
As summer approaches and university life comes to a close for good, I'm looking to continue the adventures accross the country, hopefully with some
epic summer bike rides around the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My tour of ‘The South’ finally came to a close as I left IBM in August. 
It's was a truly epic 14 months of nonstop friend making, code writing, 
landlord ranting, and train journeys. I’ve spent a large amount of time in London, seeing the sights, planning world domination and enjoying conference talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tickets" src="/images/IMG_20140816_151318.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Big Ben" src="/images/IMG_20140222_192547.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been out travelling as far as Bletchley Park and Watford, 
learning about Alan Turing and the somewhat less important (and fictional) Harry Potter.
 I’ve also once again spent a sizable number of summer evenings enjoying the company of my friend Rob in Fareham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Winchester Sunset" src="/images/IMG_20140815_194903.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunset in Winchester. My tour of 'The South' may be over, but I'll be back soon enough no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past three years I've had some 'interesting' living experiences, with everything usually descending into madness. Crazy landlords, insane hazards and genuinely disturbing living conditions have all featured in my stories at the pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in January I fled my last house, which was a good call. It's added about 30 minutes to my journey to and from work every day, however this is an hour filled with satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo above says it all, no trouble in sight.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;IBM Hursley - Hursley House&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m in the south, and while not being caught in record heat waves and
storms I’ve been engineering software, on trains and hanging out with
friends. Sometimes all three at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary reason I’m in the south however, is that I’m working at IBM
on work placement. It’s going really well, lots of challenging and
interesting work with plenty of chances to learn and network. It’s great
being in a environment densely packed with people who are passionate
about software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Winchester Cathedral" src="/images/IMG_20130428_114206.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of work, I’ve spent an awful lot of time on trains. I’ve been to
Fareham, Botley and numerous other places, visiting old and new friends.
I seem to find myself eating very civilised meals with friend’s
families around the south and visiting an awful lot of pubs.National
Rail, despite it’s problems, has facilitated some awesome weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Drinks at home" src="/images/IMG_20131013_231230.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve made a whole load of friends, and am positioned well to see some
very good old friends during the holidays. Outings out in the south have
been great, new people and new places are always the most exciting part
of moving across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Botley Train Station" src="/images/IMG_20131102_192813.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side projects continue, several new popping up and a couple (slowly)
closing. The thing I love most about side projects is working along side
people who are passionate and smart, it makes the work even more
rewarding. The south has provided even more people to collaborate with,
which of course is awesome, especially when thinking about future plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bags packed" src="/images/IMG_20131014_103053.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour continues.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
